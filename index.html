								<h2>Crime Demographics:</h2>
								<br/>
								<p>
									In this simple visualization the crime rate in different areas of city of San Francisco are highlighted on the map.
								<p>
								<br/>
								<p>
									This visualization takes the aggregation of the marked crime geographic locations and indicates the crime rate in different areas using color, where areas with most crime rate are indicated in yellow and areas with least crime rate in dark green. The dataset consists of 10000 different crime locations and types at different times in San Francico, but here they are all plotted at the same time on the map in order to find out, which is the area that has the most crime.
								</p> 
								<br/>
								<p>
									As a result, we can see which exact points are the most dangerous in the city and have the most crime overall. Almost all of the highest points are located side by side in the city.

								<h2>Filtered Crime Trends:</h2>
								<br/>
								<p>
									This visualization offers more interactivity. It provides filters to limit what is displayed in the graph. The filters allow you to look at the crime rate in different locations on a particular date and time of the the week, or by a certain category of crimes. 
								</p>
								<br/>
								<p>
									In order to use the filters one can simply select the criteria like days a and category of crime on the right panel, and crime times on the panel below the map and the results are immidiately reflected on the map. Furthermore, more information uch as exact address of the crime locations can be retrieved by clicking on the yellow dots on the map.
