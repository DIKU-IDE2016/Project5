								San Francisco is one of the happiest and most beautiful cities in the US. But did you know that the crime rate in beautiful city is one of the highest in the nation?
							</p>
							<br/>
							<p>
								In this webpage we have created visualizations that provide different kinds of information about the crime records in San Fransisco. The data for these visualizations were extracted from the dataset sf_crime.geojson, which contains 10.000 randomly sampled and geocoded crime incidents in the city of San Francisco.

								<h2>Crime Demographics:</h2>
								<br/>
								<p>
									In this simple visualization the crime rate in different areas of city of San Francisco are highlighted on the map.
								<p>
								<br/>
								<p>
									This visualization takes the aggregation of the marked crime geographic locations and indicates the crime rate in different areas using color, where areas with most crime rate are indicated in yellow and areas with least crime rate in dark green. The dataset consists of 10000 different crime locations and types at different times in San Francisco, but here they are all plotted at the same time on the map in order to find out, which is the area that has the most crime.
								</p> 
								<br/>
								<p>
									As a result, we can see which exact points are the most dangerous in the city and have the most crime overall. Almost all of the highest points are located side by side in the city.

								<h2>Filtered Crime Trends:</h2>
								<br/>
								<p>
									This visualization offers more interactivity. It provides filters to limit what is displayed in the graph. The filters allow you to look at the crime rate in different locations on a particular date and time of the the week, or by a certain category of crimes. 
								</p>
								<br/>
								<p>
									In order to use the filters one can simply select the criteria like days and category of crime on the right panel, and time of day which the crime occurred on the panel below the map and the results are immediately reflected on the map. Furthermore, more information such as exact address of the crime locations can be retrieved by clicking on the yellow dots on the map.

								</p>
								<br/>
								<p>
									Navigating the visualization and looking at general trends, we can see that the distribution of crime rates is similar in different days of the week, at any time of the day. The crime rate seems to be slightly higher in weekday and the most popular category of crime is larceny/theft.
